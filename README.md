# VBA Challenge
VBA scripting was used to analyse the generated stock market data (group by ticker symbol) for the following:

1. Yearly change of each stock from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
2. Percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
3. The total stock volume of the stock
4. Return the stock with the “Greatest % increase”
5. Return the stock with the Greatest % decrease”
6. Return the stock with the “Greatest total volume”
7. Conditional formatting for the yearly change column with Red for decreases in price and Green for increase in price

The excel file contains 3 worksheets of stocks from 2018 to 2020. The VBA script will loop through each worksheet, then loop through all stocks to take the information required as per above. 

Screenshots were also provided to view the outcome of the excel spreadsheet when scripts were run. 

Both excel file and the VBA script were also provided. 

Note: the excel file is a ~97mb file.
